In this project we are going to make a quiz game. 
We will display the image of us political map, in which states aren't marked. They will be blank.
A pop up will be  coming on the screen and we can guess and type the states name of US. 
If we get one thing correct then that state will be marked in the background. 
In order to achieve this we have three files. Namely main.py, 50_states.csv, blank_states_img.gif.
In this main.py is the main file as the name suggests, we will be writing the main execution code.
blank_states_img.gif is the file in which we have the image.
50_states.csv is a csv file. In that we have the names of the states and the x and y coordinate of them in the image file.
